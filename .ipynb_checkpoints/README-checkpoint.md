# Statistical Mechanics informed Neural Networks for Solar Wind modeling

This research project is the result of several approaches towards geomagnetic forecasting, all successful from their own way:

1. [*MHD informed Multi-Modal Neural Networks for Solar Wind modeling*](https://github.com/Jorgedavyd/Magformer)
2. *Arasci: Attention mechanisms and Res-RNNs for Geomagnetic forecasting*

Several tools were developed to ease the access to high quality scientific data and ML training:

1. [Corkit](https://github.com/Jorgedavyd/corkit): Democratizes and revamps calibration routines of corongraph data.
2. [StarStream](https://github.com/Jorgedavyd/starstream): Asynchronous data downlaoding for satellite data products.
3. [LighTorch](https://github.com/Jorgedavyd/lightorch): A Pytorch and Lightning based framework for machine learning research.
