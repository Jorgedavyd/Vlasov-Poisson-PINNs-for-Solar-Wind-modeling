A full three-dimensional compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation was conducted to distinguish between the heating mechanisms in the fast solar wind above the open field region. Our simulation describes the evolution of the Alfvénic waves, which includes the compressible effects from the photosphere to the heliospheric distance s of 27 solar radii (R⊙). The hot corona and fast solar wind were reproduced simultaneously due to the dissipation of the Alfvén waves. The inclusion of the transition region and lower atmosphere enabled us to derive the solar mass-loss rate for the first time by performing a full three-dimensional compressible MHD simulation. The Alfvén turbulence was determined to be the dominant heating mechanism in the solar wind acceleration region (s \&gt; 1.3 R⊙), as suggested by previous solar wind models. In addition, shock formation and phase mixing are important below the lower transition region (s \&lt; 1.03 R⊙) as well.}",

    abstract = {Abstract The geomagnetically induced current (GIC) produced during extreme geomagnetic storms can easily lead to large-scale blackouts in China due to the increase in the scale of its electric power grid. A power grid's resilience is its capability to resist various natural hazards, withstand primary failures, and quickly resume normal operation. To avoid power grid damages, this study developed a resilient power grid, incorporating failure, power flow calculation and recovery models under a uniform induced geoelectric field. We chose a system's performance loss as the resilience evaluation indicator, which intuitively reflected a system's loss under GIC. In addition, the recovery model was optimized using a genetic algorithm, and two resilience improvement measures were proposed. The IEEE-RTS-79 system, consisting of 10 generators, 24 buses and 5 transformers, was chosen as an example to verify the feasibility of this study. The results show that the genetic algorithm and optimization measures effectively enhanced the system's resilience indicator and provided a reference for preventing system damages under GIC and quick recovery after possible failures.},

    abstract = {Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) correspond to dramatic expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the solar corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are scientifically relevant because they are involved in the physical mechanisms characterizing the active Sun. However, more recently, CMEs have attracted attention for their impact on space weather, as they are correlated to geomagnetic storms and may induce the generation of solar energetic particle streams. In this space weather framework, the present paper introduces a physics-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the prediction of CMEs’ travel time, in which the deterministic drag-based model is exploited to improve the training phase of a cascade of two neural networks fed with both remote sensing and in situ data. This study shows that the use of physical information in the AI architecture significantly improves both the accuracy and the robustness of the travel time prediction.}

Operational space weather forecasts are commonly produced by a heliosphere model whose inner boundary is set at 18 R<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> or beyond. Such predictions typically use empirical/physics-based inner boundary conditions to solve the MHD equations for numerical simulation. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the numerical modeling of the inner heliosphere. In this paper, the numerical modeling of solar wind and coronal mass ejection in the inner heliosphere is reviewed. In particular, different inner boundary conditions used in the simulation are investigated since the MHD solutions are predetermined by the treatment of the inner boundary conditions to a large extent. Discussion is made on further development of the heliosphere model.</p>}

    abstract = {Spacecraft observations allow us to reconstruct the velocity distributions of space plasmas, which fully describe the kinetic state of the plasma. Space plasmas often exist in stationary states out of equilibrium, which are typically described by kappa distributions. Thus, the kappa index and temperature that govern these distributions are parameters that need to be determined for a full and accurate description of these plasmas. In this study, we demonstrate a novel and reliable way to determine the kappa index and temperature of plasma distribution functions constructed from counts observed in a narrow energy range by typical electrostatic sensors. Our method applies to cases in which the high-energy tail of the plasma is observed with significant uncertainty, or not observed at all. For the validation of our method, we produce pseudo-observations for typical input plasma parameters, specifically considering the design of the ion plasma instrument SWA-PAS on board the Solar Orbiter mission. Our method reliably estimates the relevant plasma parameters by fitting the angular spread of the distribution in a narrow energy range around the core bulk energy. We compare the output of our technique with the input parameters used to generate artificial data for a selected range of the kappa index and the temperature, and for a bulk energy typical for the solar wind. In addition, we study the effects of Poisson errors on the instrument’s counting statistics, test our method against Helios 2 measurements, and discuss its potential applications and limitations.}

    abstract = {Wind-induced tracking deviations of heliostats can be analyzed through numerical simulations or experimental studies on a full-scale heliostat. However, these methods are relatively costly and often, simpler estimations are necessary and sufficient. One simpler approach is to use an analytical model that describes the wind-induced tracking deviations and which requires only a few input parameters that can be determined through straightforward measurements at the full-scale heliostat. Therefore, this paper presents the derivation of an analytical model and describes the development process in a detailed way to clarify the necessary assumptions and simplifications. For verification purposes, the developed model is furthermore applied to measurement data of a field study. It is shown that the results of the model application agree well with the expectations and that the measured heliostat response matches the predicted response well, provided the underlying assumptions of the model fully apply to the investigated heliostat. Overall, no unexplainable inconsistencies are identified and the results support the model well. Thus, a method is provided which allows the estimation and prediction of wind-induced tracking deviations with comparatively little effort. In addition, the developed model helps to identify and analyze those parameters that have the greatest impact on the wind-induced tracking deviations of different types of heliostats.}

    abstract = {Abstract An accurate solar wind (SW) speed model is important for space weather predictions, catastrophic event warnings, and other issues concerning SW—magnetosphere interaction. In this work, we construct a model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) magnetic field maps, considering a SW source surface of RSS = 2.5R⊙, aiming to predict the SW speed at the Lagrange-1 (L1) point of the Sun-Earth system. The input of our model consists of four PFSS magnetic field maps at RSS, which are three, four, five, and six days before the target epoch. Reduced maps are used to promote the model's efficiency. We use the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) photospheric magnetograms and the potential field extrapolation model to generate PFSS magnetic field maps at the source surface. The model provides predictions of the quasi-continuous test data set, which is generated by randomly assigning 120 data segments that are individually continuous in time, with an averaged correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.53 ± 0.07 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 80.8 ± 4.8 km/s in an eight-fold validation training scheme with the time resolution of the data as small as one hour. The model also has the potential to forecast high speed streams of the SW, which can be quantified with a general threat score of 0.39.},

    ABSTRACT={The electrons are an essential particle species in the solar wind. They often exhibit non-equilibrium features in their velocity distribution function. These include temperature anisotropies, tails (kurtosis), and reflectional asymmetries (skewness), which contribute a significant heat flux to the solar wind. If these non-equilibrium features are sufficiently strong, they drive kinetic micro-instabilities. We develop a semi-graphical framework based on the equations of quasi-linear theory to describe electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind. We apply our framework to resonant instabilities driven by temperature anisotropies. These include the electron whistler anisotropy instability and the propagating electron firehose instability. We then describe resonant instabilities driven by reflectional asymmetries in the electron distribution function. These include the electron/ion-acoustic, kinetic Alfvén heat-flux, Langmuir, electron-beam, electron/ion-cyclotron, electron/electron-acoustic, whistler heat-flux, oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler, lower-hybrid fan, and electron-deficit whistler instability. We briefly comment on non-resonant instabilities driven by electron temperature anisotropies such as the mirror-mode and the non-propagating firehose instability. We conclude our review with a list of open research topics in the field of electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind.}
